His research focuses on the mechanisms of innate immunity and endosymbiosis in Drosophila. Lemaitre has also authored several books on the topic of narcissism in science.Lemaitre obtained a PhD in genetics from the Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie in 1992, defending a thesis on the regulation of P element transposition in Drosophila. He then pursued work as research associate in the laboratory of Jules Hoffmann, where he identified Toll-like receptors as essential mediators of innate immunity in Drosophila. This work was considered as a landmark paper by the Nobel prize committee and was featured in the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Hoffmann. In 1998, he was appointed group leader at the Molecular Genetics Center of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-Yvette. He moved to EPFL in 2007 as a full professor within the Global Health Institute.Lemaitre has since 2016 published several books and essays related to the topic of narcissism in science and society. He is co-author of various MOOCs and an exercise book in French on the topic of immunology.The Lemaitre laboratory studies various aspects of innate immunity using Drosophila as a genetic model. The laboratory uses genetic screens as tools to identify novel factors involved in the immune response following microbial infection. His team has contributed to the better understanding the role of the Toll and NF-κB pathways in the activation of bacterial defense, as well as how the host's immune system discriminates between different bacterial pathogens. Lemaitre also studies host-microbiota interactions, and more specifically how the microbiota influences gut homeostasis and morphology.Another aspect of interest to Lemaitre is to decipher the roles and mechanisms of the interactions occurring between Drosophila and its endosymbionts of the spiroplasma genus.Lemaitre received two \"Advanced Grants\" from the European Research Council for projects on gut immunity and homeostasis (2008) and Drosophila-Spiroplasma interactions (2013).Lemaitre was elected as an EMBO member in 2007.He received several research prizes, such as the Noury, Thorlet, Lazare Prize from the French Academy of Sciences (2001), the First Prize of the Schlumberger Foundation (2002), the William B.

Bargiel’s father Adolph was a well-known piano and voice teacher while his mother Mariane Tromlitz had previously been unhappily married to Clara’s father, Friedrich Wieck. Clara was nine years older than Woldemar. Throughout their lives, they enjoyed a warm relationship. The initial opportunities which led to the success and recognition he enjoyed were due to Clara, who introduced him to both Robert Schumann and Felix Mendelssohn. Bargiel received his first lessons at home and later with the well-known Berlin teacher of music theory Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn. Upon the suggestion of Schumann and the recommendation of Mendelssohn, Bargiel at age 16 went to study at the famous Leipzig Conservatory with some of the leading scholars of music: Ignaz Moscheles (piano) and Niels Gade (composition), and also with Julius Rietz. After leaving Leipzig in 1850, he returned to Berlin where he tried to make ends meet by giving private lessons. Eventually, Clara and Robert were able to arrange for the publication of some of his early works, including his First Piano Trio.Subsequently, Bargiel held positions at the conservatories in Cologne and Rotterdam (where he met Hermine Tours, his future wife, sister of the composer Berthold Tours) before accepting a position at the prestigious Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin where he taught for the rest of his life. Among his many students were Paul Juon, Waldemar von Baußnern, Alexander Ilyinsky, Agnes Tschetschulin, and Leopold Godowsky.

It became the CSN only in 1960 when it became secular. The CSN developed a close relationship with the Quebec Liberal Party and worked together to reform Québec's labor law in 1965 to extend collective bargaining to government employees. However, by the late 1960s the CSN had fallen out of favor with the provincial government as it became radicalized and threw its support behind social movements.In 1971, the three leading Quebec unions, the CSN, the CEQ teacher's union, and the Québec Federation of Labour (FTQ) voted to form the Common Front, a syndicalist organization demanding a unified minimum wage for their 250,000 members. When negotiations failed between the Common Front and the Liberal government, the unions launched the largest general strike in Canadian history. When the strike's leaders were jailed for defying orders to return to work, the strike lost momentum and the Common Front broke apart.The CSN first formally supported Quebec sovereignty in May 1990. It had, however, been associated with the sovereignty movement long before. In both the 1973 and 1976 provincial elections, the CSN, without formally endorsing the Parti québécois, let it be known that it considered the PQ to be most closely aligned with workers' interests. During the 1980 Quebec referendum, the CSN supported a yes vote on \"sovereignty-association\".The CSN is characterized by decentralized administration: local unions are organized into federations by sector of activity and regional councils, and are very independent from the central organization.

His Ph.D. advisor at Oxford was Edward Charles Titchmarsh.The following synopsis is condensed (with permission) from Mingarelli's tribute to Atkinson. He attended St Paul's School, London from 1929-1934. The High Master of St. Paul’s once wrote of Atkinson: \"Extremely promising: He should make a brilliant mathematician\"!Atkinson attended The Queen's College, Oxford in 1934 with a scholarship. During his stay at Queen's, he was secretary of the Chinese Student Society, and a member of the Indian Student Society.Auto-didactic when it came to languages, he taught himself and became fluent in Latin, Ancient Greek, Urdu, German, Hungarian, and Russian with some proficiency in Spanish, Italian, and French. His dissertation at Oxford in 1939 established, among other such results, asymptotic formulae for the average value of the square of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. His final Examining Board at Oxford University consisted of G.H. Hardy, J.E. Littlewood and E.C. Titchmarsh.His first academic appointment was at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1939-1940, followed by a commission (1940) in the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.

The last years of the reign of Isabella II were times of growing discontent with her government and with the monarchy. Salmerón joined a small party who advocated for the establishment of a republic. He was director of the opposition paper \"La Discusión\", and co-operated with Emilio Castelar on \"La Democracia\". In 1865 he was named one of the members of the directing committee of the Republican Party. In 1867 he was imprisoned with other suspects.When the revolution of September 1868 broke out, he was at Almería recovering from a serious illness. Salmerón was elected to the \"Cortes\" in 1871, and though he did not belong to the Socialist Party, defended its right to toleration. When Amadeo of Savoy resigned the Spanish crown on 11 February 1873 Salmerón was naturally marked out to be a leader of the party which endeavoured to establish a republic in Spain. After serving as minister of justice in the Figueras cabinet, he was chosen president of the \"Cortes\", and then, on 18 July 1873, president of the Executive Power of the Republic, in succession to Francisco Pi y Margall. He became president at a time when the Federalist Party had thrown all the south of Spain into anarchy.Salmerón was compelled to use the troops to restore order. When, however, he found that the generals insisted on executing rebels taken in arms, he resigned (September 6) on the ground that he was opposed to capital punishment. He was again elected president of the Cortes on September 9. His successor, Castelar, was compelled to restore order by drastic means. Salmerón took part in the attack made on him in the \"Cortes\" on 3 January 1874, which provoked the generals into closing the chamber and establishing a provisional military government. Salmerón went into exile and remained abroad till 1881, when he was recalled by Sagasta.In 1886, he was elected to the \"Cortes\" as Progressive deputy for Madrid, and unsuccessfully endeavoured to combine the jarring republican factions into a party of practical moderate views. On 18 April 1907 he was shot at, but not wounded, in the streets of Barcelona by a member of the more extreme Republican Party.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4–5 loss).The team’s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968–69. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013–14, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017. \n Carlos Alós Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n Čedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020. \n André Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021.", "keyword": ["Aug, 2018", "Currently", "first", "April 1944", "following", "1936", "1936", "1944", "whenever", "first", "the first half of the year 1945", "some weeks", "before", "World War II", "16 September 1945", "1971", "2 years", "after", "First", "Until the early 1960s", "since", "1965", "From the very beginning", "first", "after", "first", "1968–69", "Since then", "first", "until 2013–14", "for the first time", "after"]}

Daniell attended King Edward's School, Birmingham and proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge (where he was the last Senior Wrangler in 1909). At this time Daniell was an applied mathematician/theoretical physicist. For a year he lectured at the University of Liverpool and then he was appointed to the new Rice Institute in Houston, Texas. The Rice Institute had him spend a year at the University of Göttingen studying with Max Born and David Hilbert. Daniell was at Rice from 1914 to 1923 when he returned to England to a chair at the University of Sheffield. In a series of papers published between 1918 and 1928, he developed and expanded a generalized theory of integration and differentiation, which is today known as the Daniell integral. In the setting of integration, he also worked on results that lead to the Daniell-Kolmogorov extension theorem in the theory of stochastic processes, independently of Andrey Kolmogorov. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1920 at Strasbourg. During World War II Daniell advised the British Ministry of Supply. The strain of work during the war took a heavy toll on his health.

He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform. Kennedy retired from office in 1854, but continued to take keen interest in political affairs and up to his death in 1879 took a great part in both county and parish business.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4–5 loss).The team’s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968–69. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013–14, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n Čedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020. \n Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021. \n André Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018. \n Carlos Alós Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017.", "keyword": ["Mar, 2022", "Currently", "April 1944", "following", "1936", "whenever", "the first half of the year 1945", "some weeks before the end of World War II", "16 September 1945", "1971", "2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division", "Until the early 1960s", "since", "1965", "From the very beginning", "after four attempts", "1968–69", "Since then", "until 2013–14", "for the first time", "after finishing 13th in the league"]}

LevineDavid Knudsen Levine (born c. 1955) is department of Economics and Robert Schuman Center for Advanced Study Joint Chair at the European University Institute; he is John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics Emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis. His research includes the study of intellectual property and endogenous growth in dynamic general equilibrium models, the endogenous formation of preferences, social norms and institutions, learning in games, and game theory applications to experimental economics.At UCLA, Levine obtained a B.A. in mathematics in 1977, and an M.A. in economics in the same year. He was awarded a Ph.D. in economics at MIT in June 1981. He became an assistant professor of economics at UCLA in July 1981, an associate professor of economics at the University of Minnesota in 1987, and a professor of economics at UCLA in the same year. In 1997 he became the Armen Alchian Professor of Economics at UCLA. In 2006 he moved to Washington University in St. Louis, where he became the John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics.Levine was the coeditor of the \"Review of Economic Dynamics\" from November 1996 to June 2001, and of \"Econometrica\" from July 2003 to June 2008. He presided the Society for Economic Dynamics from July 2006 to June 2009.Levine is a Fellow of the Econometric Society since 1989 and a research associate at NBER since 2006.David K. Levine conducts ongoing research in general equilibrium theory, focusing specifically on growth theory, innovation, and intellectual property. Collaborating with Michele Boldrin, Levine examines the role of increasing returns in growth and innovation. They posit that little evidence exists for increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in growth. This theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.Levine also conducts research in the field of dynamic games. He established with Drew Fudenberg that a long-lived player playing in opposition to short-lived players can substitute reputation for commitment. He developed with Eric Maskin the first \"folk theorem\" for games in which players do not directly observe each other's decisions, with applications for learning in games. They argued that while learning theories cannot provide detailed descriptions of non-equilibrium behavior, they act as a useful tool in understanding which equilibria are likely to emerge. One example of this, they put forward, explains how superstitions survive in the face of rational learning.Levine currently studies the endogenous formation of preferences and social norms. His analysis of experimental anomalies explores some of the limitations of the standard economic model of self-interested individuals.", "fact_context": "David K.

His research focuses on the mechanisms of innate immunity and endosymbiosis in Drosophila. Lemaitre has also authored several books on the topic of narcissism in science.Lemaitre obtained a PhD in genetics from the Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie in 1992, defending a thesis on the regulation of P element transposition in Drosophila. He then pursued work as research associate in the laboratory of Jules Hoffmann, where he identified Toll-like receptors as essential mediators of innate immunity in Drosophila. This work was considered as a landmark paper by the Nobel prize committee and was featured in the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Hoffmann. In 1998, he was appointed group leader at the Molecular Genetics Center of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-Yvette. He moved to EPFL in 2007 as a full professor within the Global Health Institute.Lemaitre has since 2016 published several books and essays related to the topic of narcissism in science and society. He is co-author of various MOOCs and an exercise book in French on the topic of immunology.The Lemaitre laboratory studies various aspects of innate immunity using Drosophila as a genetic model. The laboratory uses genetic screens as tools to identify novel factors involved in the immune response following microbial infection. His team has contributed to the better understanding the role of the Toll and NF-κB pathways in the activation of bacterial defense, as well as how the host's immune system discriminates between different bacterial pathogens. Lemaitre also studies host-microbiota interactions, and more specifically how the microbiota influences gut homeostasis and morphology.Another aspect of interest to Lemaitre is to decipher the roles and mechanisms of the interactions occurring between Drosophila and its endosymbionts of the spiroplasma genus.Lemaitre received two \"Advanced Grants\" from the European Research Council for projects on gut immunity and homeostasis (2008) and Drosophila-Spiroplasma interactions (2013).Lemaitre was elected as an EMBO member in 2007.He received several research prizes, such as the Noury, Thorlet, Lazare Prize from the French Academy of Sciences (2001), the First Prize of the Schlumberger Foundation (2002), the William B.

In Vishniac (1983), he demonstrated that a blast wave expanding in a sufficiently compressible medium would be subject to a linear overstability growing as the square root of time. This is usually known as the Vishniac instability, and generally occurs in any thin enough slab bounded by a shock on one side and a contact discontinuity to a higher temperature region on the other. In Vishniac (1994) he then demonstrated that a thin-enough slab bounded by shocks on both sides is subject to a nonlinear instability, usually described as a nonlinear thin shell instability (NTSI).

He studied for the bar and became advocate in 1811. Having been elected Member of Parliament for the Ayr Burghs in 1818, he devoted the greater part of his life to the promotion of liberal reforms.In 1820 he married the only daughter of Sir Samuel Romilly. He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform. Kennedy retired from office in 1854, but continued to take keen interest in political affairs and up to his death in 1879 took a great part in both county and parish business.

In 2008 he was appointed associate professor, and in 2017 full professor. Before that, he worked at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, and MIT in the United States. He received his PhD from the University of Amsterdam in 1999 with a thesis entitled \"Millisecond phenomena in X-ray binaries\".His research focuses on the accretion of matter onto neutron stars and black holes, which are very compact stellar remnants. He uses X-ray space telescopes such as Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton to observe the X-ray emission from these objects. In particular he studies neutron stars and black holes when they are accreting at very low rates. He also investigates the rate at which neutron stars cool after they have been heated by accretion, in order to learn about their interior composition.

He studied for the bar and became advocate in 1811. Having been elected Member of Parliament for the Ayr Burghs in 1818, he devoted the greater part of his life to the promotion of liberal reforms.In 1820 he married the only daughter of Sir Samuel Romilly. He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy.

After graduating, he lectured at the University of Marburg from 1916, and was promoted to professor in 1922.In 1919 he married Wilhelmina Malka A. Prins (1892–1983). Due to the severe housing shortage in post-war Germany, for a few years the couple lived as subtenants at professor Hensel's place.After leaving Marburg in 1928, Fraenkel taught at the University of Kiel for a year. He then made the fateful choice of accepting a position at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had been founded four years earlier, where he spent the rest of his career. He became the first Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, and for a while served as Rector of the University.Fraenkel was a fervent Zionist and as such was a member of Jewish National Council and the Jewish Assembly of Representatives under the British mandate. He also belonged to the Mizrachi religious wing of Zionism, which promoted Jewish religious education and schools, and which advocated giving the Chief Rabbinate authority over marriage and divorce.Fraenkel's early work was on Kurt Hensel's p-adic numbers and on the theory of rings.

The building is three stories high and based on an Elizabethan-style \"E\"-shaped plan. The design is similar to that of the station but more subdued; the building was extended in 1878. The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls—a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success. When the NSR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, the LMS took over the hotel and found the business in poor condition. When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space. Not all the extensions were conducted sympathetically to the original architectural style, resulting in a variety of architectural styles to the rear of the building.The hotel became a listed building in 1972 and is listed in grade II*.

He was the co-founder of the Courant Institute at New York University, and a recipient of the National Medal of Science.Friedrichs was born in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein on September 28, 1901. His family soon moved to Düsseldorf, where he grew up. He attended several different universities in Germany studying the philosophical works of Heidegger and Husserl, but finally decided that mathematics was his real calling. During the 1920s, Friedrichs pursued this field in Göttingen, which had a renowned Mathematical Institute under the direction of Richard Courant. Courant became a close colleague and lifelong friend of Friedrichs.In 1931, Friedrichs became a full professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule in Braunschweig. In early February 1933, a few days after Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany, Friedrichs met and immediately fell in love with a young Jewish student, Nellie Bruell. Their relationship became increasingly challenging and difficult because of the anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws of Hitler's government. In 1937, both Friedrichs and Nellie Bruell managed to emigrate separately to New York City where they finally married. Their long and very happy marriage produced five children.Courant had left Germany in 1933 and had founded an institute for graduate studies in mathematics at New York University. Friedrichs joined him when he arrived in 1937 and remained there for forty years. He was instrumental in the development of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, which eventually became one of the most distinguished research institutes for applied mathematics in the world. Friedrichs died in New Rochelle, New York on December 31, 1982.Friedrichs's greatest contribution to applied mathematics was his work on partial differential equations. He also did major research and wrote many books and papers on existence theory, numerical methods, differential operators in Hilbert space, non-linear buckling of plates, flows past wings, solitary waves, shock waves, combustion, magneto-fluid dynamical shock waves, relativistic flows, quantum field theory, perturbation of the continuous spectrum, scattering theory, and symmetric hyperbolic equations. With Cartan, Friedrichs gave a \"geometrized\" formulation of Newtonian gravitation theory—also knownas “Newton–Cartan theory”— and later developed by Dautcourt, Dixon, Dombrowski and Horneffer, Ehlers, Havas, Künzle, Lottermoser, Trautman, and others.A member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1959, Friedrichs received many honorary degrees and awards for his work. There is a student prize named after Friedrichs at NYU. The American Mathematical Society selected him as the Josiah Willards Gibbs lecturer for 1954. In November 1977, Friedrichs received the National Medal of Science from President Jimmy Carter \"for bringing the powers of modern mathematics to bear on problems in physics, fluid dynamics, and elasticity.\"", "fact_context": "Kurt O.

He is known for his contributions to axiomatic set theory, especially his additions to Ernst Zermelo's axioms, which resulted in the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.Abraham Adolf Halevi Fraenkel studied mathematics at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Marburg and Breslau. After graduating, he lectured at the University of Marburg from 1916, and was promoted to professor in 1922.In 1919 he married Wilhelmina Malka A. Prins (1892–1983). Due to the severe housing shortage in post-war Germany, for a few years the couple lived as subtenants at professor Hensel's place.After leaving Marburg in 1928, Fraenkel taught at the University of Kiel for a year. He then made the fateful choice of accepting a position at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had been founded four years earlier, where he spent the rest of his career. He became the first Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, and for a while served as Rector of the University.Fraenkel was a fervent Zionist and as such was a member of Jewish National Council and the Jewish Assembly of Representatives under the British mandate. He also belonged to the Mizrachi religious wing of Zionism, which promoted Jewish religious education and schools, and which advocated giving the Chief Rabbinate authority over marriage and divorce.Fraenkel's early work was on Kurt Hensel's p-adic numbers and on the theory of rings. He is best known for his work on axiomatic set theory, publishing his first major work on the topic \"Einleitung in die Mengenlehre\" (Introduction to set theory) in 1919.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4–5 loss).The team’s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968–69. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013–14, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017. \n Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Carlos Alós Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n André Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021. \n Čedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020.", "keyword": ["Sep, 2017", "Currently", "April 1944", "following", "the year 1936", "the year 1936", "the year 1944", "whenever", "the first football match", "the first half of the year 1945", "some weeks before the end of World War II", "The first recorded encounter", "16 September 1945", "1971", "2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division", "Until the early 1960s", "since", "1965", "From the very beginning", "after four attempts", "1968–69", "Since then", "until 2013–14", "for the first time", "after finishing 13th in the league"]}

He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform.

Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing.

His research includes the study of intellectual property and endogenous growth in dynamic general equilibrium models, the endogenous formation of preferences, social norms and institutions, learning in games, and game theory applications to experimental economics.At UCLA, Levine obtained a B.A. in mathematics in 1977, and an M.A. in economics in the same year. He was awarded a Ph.D. in economics at MIT in June 1981. He became an assistant professor of economics at UCLA in July 1981, an associate professor of economics at the University of Minnesota in 1987, and a professor of economics at UCLA in the same year. In 1997 he became the Armen Alchian Professor of Economics at UCLA. In 2006 he moved to Washington University in St. Louis, where he became the John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics.Levine was the coeditor of the \"Review of Economic Dynamics\" from November 1996 to June 2001, and of \"Econometrica\" from July 2003 to June 2008. He presided the Society for Economic Dynamics from July 2006 to June 2009.Levine is a Fellow of the Econometric Society since 1989 and a research associate at NBER since 2006.David K. Levine conducts ongoing research in general equilibrium theory, focusing specifically on growth theory, innovation, and intellectual property. Collaborating with Michele Boldrin, Levine examines the role of increasing returns in growth and innovation. They posit that little evidence exists for increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in growth. This theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.Levine also conducts research in the field of dynamic games. He established with Drew Fudenberg that a long-lived player playing in opposition to short-lived players can substitute reputation for commitment. He developed with Eric Maskin the first \"folk theorem\" for games in which players do not directly observe each other's decisions, with applications for learning in games. They argued that while learning theories cannot provide detailed descriptions of non-equilibrium behavior, they act as a useful tool in understanding which equilibria are likely to emerge. One example of this, they put forward, explains how superstitions survive in the face of rational learning.Levine currently studies the endogenous formation of preferences and social norms. His analysis of experimental anomalies explores some of the limitations of the standard economic model of self-interested individuals.", "fact_context": "David K.

Economist Milton Friedman said Savage was \"one of the few people I have met whom I would unhesitatingly call a genius.\"He graduated from the University of Michigan and later worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University. Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors.His most noted work was the 1954 book \"The Foundations of Statistics\", in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory.During World War II, Savage served as chief \"statistical\" assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \"random walk\" (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.In 1951 he introduced the minimax regret criterion used in decision theory.The Hewitt–Savage zero–one law is (in part) named after him, as is the Friedman–Savage utility function.", "fact_context": "Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Cornell University from Jan, 1942 to Jan, 1943. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Chicago from Jan, 1946 to Jan, 1960. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Institute for Advanced Study from Jan, 1941 to Jan, 1942. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Columbia University from Jan, 1944 to Jan, 1945. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Yale University from Jan, 1964 to Jan, 1971. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Brown University from Jan, 1943 to Jan, 1944. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences from Jan, 1945 to Jan, 1946. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Michigan from Jan, 1960 to Jan, 1964.", "keyword": ["Apr, 1963", "20 November 1917", "1 November 1971", "later", "1954", "During World War II", "Later", "subsequent", "subsequently", "1951"]}

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4–5 loss).The team’s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968–69. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013–14, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "Čedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021. \n Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Carlos Alós Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017. \n Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n André Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018.", "keyword": ["in May, 2021", "Currently", "April 1944", "following", "1936", "1936", "whenever", "first football match", "the first half of the year 1945", "some weeks before the end of World War II", "first recorded encounter", "16 September 1945", "1971", "2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division", "Until the early 1960s", "In 1965", "From the very beginning", "after four attempts", "1968–69", "Since then", "until 2013–14", "for the first time", "after finishing 13th in the league"]}

It became the CSN only in 1960 when it became secular. The CSN developed a close relationship with the Quebec Liberal Party and worked together to reform Québec's labor law in 1965 to extend collective bargaining to government employees. However, by the late 1960s the CSN had fallen out of favor with the provincial government as it became radicalized and threw its support behind social movements.In 1971, the three leading Quebec unions, the CSN, the CEQ teacher's union, and the Québec Federation of Labour (FTQ) voted to form the Common Front, a syndicalist organization demanding a unified minimum wage for their 250,000 members. When negotiations failed between the Common Front and the Liberal government, the unions launched the largest general strike in Canadian history. When the strike's leaders were jailed for defying orders to return to work, the strike lost momentum and the Common Front broke apart.The CSN first formally supported Quebec sovereignty in May 1990. It had, however, been associated with the sovereignty movement long before. In both the 1973 and 1976 provincial elections, the CSN, without formally endorsing the Parti québécois, let it be known that it considered the PQ to be most closely aligned with workers' interests. During the 1980 Quebec referendum, the CSN supported a yes vote on \"sovereignty-association\".The CSN is characterized by decentralized administration: local unions are organized into federations by sector of activity and regional councils, and are very independent from the central organization. It is also the most politically active trade union in Quebec.The Confederation currently has about 300,000 members, distributed evenly between men and women, and between the private and public sectors.

After Harvard, Vishniac spent two years as a post doctoral fellow working under Jeremiah P. Ostriker at Princeton University.His best known scientific work is the study of instabilities in expanding blast waves. In Vishniac (1983), he demonstrated that a blast wave expanding in a sufficiently compressible medium would be subject to a linear overstability growing as the square root of time. This is usually known as the Vishniac instability, and generally occurs in any thin enough slab bounded by a shock on one side and a contact discontinuity to a higher temperature region on the other. In Vishniac (1994) he then demonstrated that a thin-enough slab bounded by shocks on both sides is subject to a nonlinear instability, usually described as a nonlinear thin shell instability (NTSI).

The last years of the reign of Isabella II were times of growing discontent with her government and with the monarchy. Salmerón joined a small party who advocated for the establishment of a republic. He was director of the opposition paper \"La Discusión\", and co-operated with Emilio Castelar on \"La Democracia\". In 1865 he was named one of the members of the directing committee of the Republican Party. In 1867 he was imprisoned with other suspects.When the revolution of September 1868 broke out, he was at Almería recovering from a serious illness. Salmerón was elected to the \"Cortes\" in 1871, and though he did not belong to the Socialist Party, defended its right to toleration. When Amadeo of Savoy resigned the Spanish crown on 11 February 1873 Salmerón was naturally marked out to be a leader of the party which endeavoured to establish a republic in Spain. After serving as minister of justice in the Figueras cabinet, he was chosen president of the \"Cortes\", and then, on 18 July 1873, president of the Executive Power of the Republic, in succession to Francisco Pi y Margall. He became president at a time when the Federalist Party had thrown all the south of Spain into anarchy.Salmerón was compelled to use the troops to restore order. When, however, he found that the generals insisted on executing rebels taken in arms, he resigned (September 6) on the ground that he was opposed to capital punishment. He was again elected president of the Cortes on September 9. His successor, Castelar, was compelled to restore order by drastic means. Salmerón took part in the attack made on him in the \"Cortes\" on 3 January 1874, which provoked the generals into closing the chamber and establishing a provisional military government. Salmerón went into exile and remained abroad till 1881, when he was recalled by Sagasta.In 1886, he was elected to the \"Cortes\" as Progressive deputy for Madrid, and unsuccessfully endeavoured to combine the jarring republican factions into a party of practical moderate views. On 18 April 1907 he was shot at, but not wounded, in the streets of Barcelona by a member of the more extreme Republican Party.

After graduating, he lectured at the University of Marburg from 1916, and was promoted to professor in 1922.In 1919 he married Wilhelmina Malka A. Prins (1892–1983). Due to the severe housing shortage in post-war Germany, for a few years the couple lived as subtenants at professor Hensel's place.After leaving Marburg in 1928, Fraenkel taught at the University of Kiel for a year. He then made the fateful choice of accepting a position at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had been founded four years earlier, where he spent the rest of his career. He became the first Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, and for a while served as Rector of the University.Fraenkel was a fervent Zionist and as such was a member of Jewish National Council and the Jewish Assembly of Representatives under the British mandate.

It is exhibited at the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam, and signed, below the window in the lower left-hand corner, \"I V MEER\".The painting is made in oil on canvas, and it is a relatively small painting, being high by wide.The painting, showing a quiet street, depicts a typical aspect of the life in a Dutch Golden Age town. It is one of only three Vermeer paintings of views of Delft, the others being \"View of Delft\" and the now lost \"House Standing in Delft\". This painting is considered to be an important work of the Dutch master.Straight angles alternate with the triangle of the house and of the sky giving the composition a certain vitality. The walls, stones and brickwork are painted in a thicker paint layer, such that it makes them almost palpable.Vermeer achieved the realistic depiction of the surfaces with the masterful application of a relatively limited number of pigments. He employed red ochre and madder lake for the reddish-brown brick wall, the blue in the sky contains lead white and natural ultramarine. The green shutters and foliage are painted with azurite mixed with lead-tin-yellow.While generally agreed to depict a contemporary street scene in 17th-century Delft, where Vermeer lived and worked, the exact location of the scene Vermeer painted has long been a topic of research and discussion, with studies arguing for the Voldersgracht, where the Vermeer Centre is located, or the Nieuwe Langendijk at the present-day numbers 22 to 26.In 2015, archival research based on the city's quay dues register, which gives detailed measurements of all houses and passageways along the canals of Delft at the time, has resulted in the conclusion that the site is the Vlamingstraat, a street with a narrow canal, at the present-day numbers 40 and 42.The research also found that the property on the right in the painting belonged to Vermeer’s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne. She had a business selling tripe, and the passageway beside the house was known as the \"Penspoort\", or Tripe Gate. Vermeer’s mother and sister also lived on the same canal, diagonally opposite.In 2017, this apparently sound conclusion was disputed by art historians Gert Eijkelboom and Gerrit Vermeer in the Dutch \"Journal of Historical Geography\" (\"Tijdschrift voor historische geografie\"). Their argumentation is essentially founded in the assertion that the painting does not depict an actual place, and thus cannot be accurately located. The authors said: \"We do not know whether the question will ever be answered, because it seems that Vermeer's world-famous work is an allegorical representation, which he compiled from various elements and places.\"", "fact_context": "The Little Street is owned by Jan Pieter Six VI from Jan, 1847 to Jan, 1899. \n The Little Street is owned by Pieter Hendrik Six van Vromade from Jan, 1899 to Jan, 1905. \n The Little Street is owned by Hendrik Six van Hillegom from Jan, 1845 to Jan, 1847.", "keyword": ["Nov, 1900", "c. 1657–58", "now lost", "While", "contemporary", "17th-century", "has long been", "present-day numbers 22 to 26", "In 2015", "at the time", "present-day numbers 40 and 42", "In 2017", "ever"]}

At Bonn his fellow students included Georg Kaibel, Friedrich von Duhn, Georg Dehio and Hans Delbrück. After graduation in 1873 he toured countries of the Mediterranean extensively.In 1881 he became an associate professor at the University of Kiel, followed by professorships at the Universities of Rostock (1883), Strasbourg (1888) and Göttingen (1889). At the latter institution he was university rector (1903–4), and was a colleague of Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. In 1889 he became a member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences.Much of Leo's earlier work concerned research of Seneca's tragedies and the writings of Venantius Fortunatus. Later his focus dealt largely with works of Roman playwright Plautus and early Roman literature in general.

Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing.

Since 1994, younger people in that age group have also been able to become a member of Jusos without party membership. Until 2011 this was free, but ended after a two 2-year period. Today, it is possible to be a member of only Jusos until you reach your 35th birthday. However, there is now a membership fee of €1 per month.The Jusos were founded between 1918 and 1920, when groups of members of the SPD between 20 and 25 years of age began to meet. In terms of numbers, the Jusos remained small, with between 3,000 and 5,000 members. They were dissolved in 1931 as a result of an internal controversy.After the end of World War II, the Jusos was refounded in 1946.

It is exhibited at the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam, and signed, below the window in the lower left-hand corner, \"I V MEER\".The painting is made in oil on canvas, and it is a relatively small painting, being high by wide.The painting, showing a quiet street, depicts a typical aspect of the life in a Dutch Golden Age town. It is one of only three Vermeer paintings of views of Delft, the others being \"View of Delft\" and the now lost \"House Standing in Delft\". This painting is considered to be an important work of the Dutch master.Straight angles alternate with the triangle of the house and of the sky giving the composition a certain vitality. The walls, stones and brickwork are painted in a thicker paint layer, such that it makes them almost palpable.Vermeer achieved the realistic depiction of the surfaces with the masterful application of a relatively limited number of pigments. He employed red ochre and madder lake for the reddish-brown brick wall, the blue in the sky contains lead white and natural ultramarine. The green shutters and foliage are painted with azurite mixed with lead-tin-yellow.While generally agreed to depict a contemporary street scene in 17th-century Delft, where Vermeer lived and worked, the exact location of the scene Vermeer painted has long been a topic of research and discussion, with studies arguing for the Voldersgracht, where the Vermeer Centre is located, or the Nieuwe Langendijk at the present-day numbers 22 to 26.In 2015, archival research based on the city's quay dues register, which gives detailed measurements of all houses and passageways along the canals of Delft at the time, has resulted in the conclusion that the site is the Vlamingstraat, a street with a narrow canal, at the present-day numbers 40 and 42.The research also found that the property on the right in the painting belonged to Vermeer’s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne. She had a business selling tripe, and the passageway beside the house was known as the \"Penspoort\", or Tripe Gate. Vermeer’s mother and sister also lived on the same canal, diagonally opposite.In 2017, this apparently sound conclusion was disputed by art historians Gert Eijkelboom and Gerrit Vermeer in the Dutch \"Journal of Historical Geography\" (\"Tijdschrift voor historische geografie\"). Their argumentation is essentially founded in the assertion that the painting does not depict an actual place, and thus cannot be accurately located. The authors said: \"We do not know whether the question will ever be answered, because it seems that Vermeer's world-famous work is an allegorical representation, which he compiled from various elements and places.\"", "fact_context": "The Little Street is owned by Hendrik Six van Hillegom from Jan, 1845 to Jan, 1847. \n The Little Street is owned by Pieter Hendrik Six van Vromade from Jan, 1899 to Jan, 1905. \n The Little Street is owned by Jan Pieter Six VI from Jan, 1847 to Jan, 1899.", "keyword": ["Mar, 1846", "c. 1657–58", "Dutch Golden Age", "now", "While", "contemporary", "17th-century", "long", "present-day numbers 22 to 26", "In 2015", "at the time", "present-day numbers 40 and 42", "In 2017", "ever"]}

He has been a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly since 2004, representing three successive seats: Charters Towers (2004–2009), Dalrymple (2009–2017) and Hill (2017–present). He has variously represented the National Party (2004–08), the Liberal National Party (2008–11) and Katter's Australian Party (2011–present).Knuth was born in the Queensland town of Tully. His brother Jeff Knuth is a former One Nation parliamentarian.Shane Knuth entered the state parliament as the member for Charters Towers at the 2004 state election by defeating incumbent MP Christine Scott of the Labor Party on One Nation preferences. At the 2006 state election, Knuth was re-elected with a large swing.Charters Towers was abolished in a redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election, and Knuth opted to contest the new seat of Dalrymple. The new seat merged most of his former territory, including the city of Charters Towers, with part of the former seat of Tablelands, represented by One Nation MP Rosa Lee Long. The new seat had a notional LNP majority of 57 percent, and Knuth won with only a small swing against him.On 30 October 2011, Knuth resigned from the Liberal National Party to join Katter's Australian Party.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4–5 loss).The team’s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968–69. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013–14, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017. \n Carlos Alós Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n Čedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021. \n Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n André Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018.", "keyword": ["in Mar, 2021", "Currently", "April 1944", "following", "the year 1936", "the year 1936", "the year 1944", "whenever", "the first half of the year 1945", "some weeks before the end of World War II", "The first recorded encounter", "16 September 1945", "1971", "2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division", "Until the early 1960s", "1965", "From the very beginning", "after four attempts", "1968–69", "Since then", "until 2013–14", "for the first time", "after finishing 13th in the league"]}

After graduation in 1873 he toured countries of the Mediterranean extensively.In 1881 he became an associate professor at the University of Kiel, followed by professorships at the Universities of Rostock (1883), Strasbourg (1888) and Göttingen (1889). At the latter institution he was university rector (1903–4), and was a colleague of Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. In 1889 he became a member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences.Much of Leo's earlier work concerned research of Seneca's tragedies and the writings of Venantius Fortunatus.

One seat was reserved for the candidate who came second.

He received his Ph.D. at Chicago in 1949, with a dissertation on \"The Offering at Meals: Its Place in Greek Sacrifice\". A Fulbright Fellowship in 1949 supported him at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, where he hiked the Peloponnesos with his new wife and gained an intimate knowledge of inscriptions. After a brief stint at the University of Minnesota, he accepted a Ford Fellowship at the Institute for Social Anthropology at Oxford University. On his return to the United States, be began his long association with the University of Pennsylvania (1954–76).Though a spirit of perfectionism inhibited his production of an overarching book, in some sixty articles he explored the setting of Greek religion in its specific locality and time, thus focusing on unravelling the details of cult and ritual sacrifice; he did a great deal of work on epigraphy and its relations with literature and history, and he explored Greek sites, especially at the partly drowned port city of Halieis (Porto Cheli), which he began excavating in 1962, and in the Argolid, where he galvanized a broad ecological study, 1979–83, that was the first examination of the paleoecology of ancient Greece, resulting in the publication of M.

He was the first mayor of Rochdale on the town's incorporation as a municipal borough. He stood for election in 1865 in Manchester.

He became top goalscorer of Twente's reserves and also won the cup with the second squad. He was rewarded with a new four-year contract, which he signed, keeping him in Enschede until 2011. It was also announced that he would join Go Ahead Eagles on loan for the next one-and-a-half season.On 18 January 2009, Reimerink made his Eerste Divisie debut for \"the Eagles\". He was positioned as right striker in the starting lineup. Go Ahead Eagles, however, were defeated 0–1 by Zwolle through a goal scored by Derk Boerrigter. After having played six matches – five matches in the starting lineup, one as a substitute – he suffered a fracture in his left ankle. This meant that Reimerink was ruled out for four to six weeks In the 2009–10 season, Reimerink stayed on loan at Go Ahead Eagles. This resulted in a strong season for Reimerink, scoring four goals and being chosen as one of the top talents of the Eerste Divisie.In 2010, he signed a four-year contract with German club FC Energie Cottbus. In his first year under head coach Claus-Dieter Wollitz, he performed well.

In 2008 he was appointed associate professor, and in 2017 full professor. Before that, he worked at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, and MIT in the United States. He received his PhD from the University of Amsterdam in 1999 with a thesis entitled \"Millisecond phenomena in X-ray binaries\".His research focuses on the accretion of matter onto neutron stars and black holes, which are very compact stellar remnants. He uses X-ray space telescopes such as Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton to observe the X-ray emission from these objects. In particular he studies neutron stars and black holes when they are accreting at very low rates. He also investigates the rate at which neutron stars cool after they have been heated by accretion, in order to learn about their interior composition. Furthermore, Wijnands has been involved in research into quasi-periodic oscillations.In 1998, Wijnands and his PhD advisor Michiel van der Klis discovered coherent millisecond X-ray pulsations in the persistent flux of the X-ray binary SAX J1808.4-3658. This was strong evidence for the model in which radio millisecond pulsars are spun up to periods of a few milliseconds by the accretion of matter from a companion star in an X-ray binary.In 2006 Wijnands received the Bruno Rossi Prize along with Deepto Chakrabarty and Tod Strohmayer \"for their pioneering research which revealed millisecond spin periods and established the powerful diagnostic tool of kilohertz intensity oscillations in accreting neutron star binary systems\".", "fact_context": "Rudy Wijnands works for University of St Andrews from Sep, 2002 to Sep, 2003. \n Rudy Wijnands works for Massachusetts Institute of Technology from Sep, 1999 to Aug, 2002. \n Rudy Wijnands works for University of Amsterdam from Feb, 1999 to Aug, 1999.", "keyword": ["in Oct, 2002", "born 1971", "Since 2004", "In 2008", "in 2017", "Before that", "in 1999", "Millisecond phenomena", "after", "In 1998", "coherent millisecond X-ray pulsations", "a few milliseconds", "In 2006", "millisecond spin periods", "kilohertz intensity oscillations"]}

The building is three stories high and based on an Elizabethan-style \"E\"-shaped plan. The design is similar to that of the station but more subdued; the building was extended in 1878. The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls—a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success. When the NSR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, the LMS took over the hotel and found the business in poor condition. When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space. Not all the extensions were conducted sympathetically to the original architectural style, resulting in a variety of architectural styles to the rear of the building.The hotel became a listed building in 1972 and is listed in grade II*.

In 1670, he was promoted to the rank of \"jinshi\" and moved to Beijing, leaving his brother Li Guangpo behind to look after his family. Li's career prospects improved when the Emperor pacified Fujian and acted on Li's suggestion to defeat Wu Sangui. He also helped defeat Geng Jingzhong, persuading his friend Chen Minglei to work as a spy in Geng's camp. Later in life, he was responsible for planning Shi Lang's conquest of Taiwan. During the course of his life, Li held various court positions, including Chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, Governor of Zhili and Grand Secretary, and positions on the Board of War, Board of Civil Service and the Board of Public Works.Li's philosophy was rooted in the Cheng-Zhu school. However, despite being a follower of Zhu Xi he did not entirely disregard the teachings of Zhu's rivals Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming. He also highlighted similarities between the teachings of Confucius and those of Buddha and Lao Tzu. Li felt that human nature (which he believed to be inherently good) was the ultimate subject of his study, and that nature was the guiding principle on which to base human morality.

He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform.

He was the co-founder of the Courant Institute at New York University, and a recipient of the National Medal of Science.Friedrichs was born in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein on September 28, 1901. His family soon moved to Düsseldorf, where he grew up. He attended several different universities in Germany studying the philosophical works of Heidegger and Husserl, but finally decided that mathematics was his real calling. During the 1920s, Friedrichs pursued this field in Göttingen, which had a renowned Mathematical Institute under the direction of Richard Courant. Courant became a close colleague and lifelong friend of Friedrichs.In 1931, Friedrichs became a full professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule in Braunschweig. In early February 1933, a few days after Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany, Friedrichs met and immediately fell in love with a young Jewish student, Nellie Bruell. Their relationship became increasingly challenging and difficult because of the anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws of Hitler's government. In 1937, both Friedrichs and Nellie Bruell managed to emigrate separately to New York City where they finally married. Their long and very happy marriage produced five children.Courant had left Germany in 1933 and had founded an institute for graduate studies in mathematics at New York University. Friedrichs joined him when he arrived in 1937 and remained there for forty years. He was instrumental in the development of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, which eventually became one of the most distinguished research institutes for applied mathematics in the world. Friedrichs died in New Rochelle, New York on December 31, 1982.Friedrichs's greatest contribution to applied mathematics was his work on partial differential equations. He also did major research and wrote many books and papers on existence theory, numerical methods, differential operators in Hilbert space, non-linear buckling of plates, flows past wings, solitary waves, shock waves, combustion, magneto-fluid dynamical shock waves, relativistic flows, quantum field theory, perturbation of the continuous spectrum, scattering theory, and symmetric hyperbolic equations. With Cartan, Friedrichs gave a \"geometrized\" formulation of Newtonian gravitation theory—also knownas “Newton–Cartan theory”— and later developed by Dautcourt, Dixon, Dombrowski and Horneffer, Ehlers, Havas, Künzle, Lottermoser, Trautman, and others.A member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1959, Friedrichs received many honorary degrees and awards for his work. There is a student prize named after Friedrichs at NYU. The American Mathematical Society selected him as the Josiah Willards Gibbs lecturer for 1954. In November 1977, Friedrichs received the National Medal of Science from President Jimmy Carter \"for bringing the powers of modern mathematics to bear on problems in physics, fluid dynamics, and elasticity.\"", "fact_context": "Kurt O.

Andræ was by royal appointment a member of the 1848 Danish Constituent Assembly.

He is the son of microbiologist Wolf V. Vishniac, and grandson of photographer Roman Vishniac. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Astrophysical Journal and a professor of Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, after holding positions at University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and University of Texas in Austin. His wife Ilene Busch-Vishniac, the ninth president of the University of Saskatchewan (2012-2014), was previously Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at Johns Hopkins, and provost and vice-president (academic) of McMaster University from 2007 until 2012.Vishniac graduated from University of Rochester and Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. in astrophysics in 1980 from Harvard University while working under the direction of William H. Press. After Harvard, Vishniac spent two years as a post doctoral fellow working under Jeremiah P. Ostriker at Princeton University.His best known scientific work is the study of instabilities in expanding blast waves. In Vishniac (1983), he demonstrated that a blast wave expanding in a sufficiently compressible medium would be subject to a linear overstability growing as the square root of time.

Râșnov was mentioned for the first time in 1331 as \"Rosnou\" and again in 1388 as \"villa Rosarum\". While the village was razed many times in its history by Tatars, Turks and Wallachians, the castle was conquered only once, in 1612 by Gabriel Báthory.In 2002, the Râșnov Fortress and surroundings were used during the shooting of several scenes from the American film \"Cold Mountain\".There is a myth attached to Râșnov Citadel. During a particularly long siege of the fortress, the citizens of Râșnov were concerned about the lack of available fresh drinking water. Two Turkish soldiers, having been captured earlier, were put to the task of digging a well in the centre of the fortress. These two men were assured that they would be given their freedom once the well was completed. According to local legend, it took them 17 years to finish the well, but they were still killed afterwards.

There are many Slutsky analogs in producer theory.He is less well known by Western economists than some of his contemporaries, due to his own changing intellectual interests as well as external factors forced upon him after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. His seminal paper in Economics, and some argue his last paper in Economics rather than probability theory, was published in 1915 (\"Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore\"). Paul Samuelson noted that until 1936, he had been entirely unaware of Slutsky's 1915 \"masterpiece\" due to World War I and the paper's Italian language publication. R. G. D. Allen did the most to propagate Slutsky's work on consumer theory in published papers in 1936 and 1950.Vincent Barnett argues:In the 1920s Slutsky turned to working on probability theory and stochastic processes, but in 1927 he published his second famous article on economic theory, 'The Summation of Random Causes as a Source of Cyclical Processes'. This showed that it was possible for apparently cyclic behaviour to emerge as the result of random shocks to the economy if the latter were modelled using a stable stochastic difference equation with certain technical properties.

Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors.His most noted work was the 1954 book \"The Foundations of Statistics\", in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory.During World War II, Savage served as chief \"statistical\" assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \"random walk\" (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.In 1951 he introduced the minimax regret criterion used in decision theory.The Hewitt–Savage zero–one law is (in part) named after him, as is the Friedman–Savage utility function.", "fact_context": "Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Brown University from Jan, 1943 to Jan, 1944. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences from Jan, 1945 to Jan, 1946. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Yale University from Jan, 1964 to Jan, 1971. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Institute for Advanced Study from Jan, 1941 to Jan, 1942. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Cornell University from Jan, 1942 to Jan, 1943. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Michigan from Jan, 1960 to Jan, 1964. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Chicago from Jan, 1946 to Jan, 1960. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Columbia University from Jan, 1944 to Jan, 1945.", "keyword": ["in Aug, 1970", "20 November 1917", "1 November 1971", "later", "1954", "During World War II", "Later", "subsequent", "subsequently", "In 1951"]}

His father was a Russian medical doctor, and his mother was ethnically German; the family spoke German at home. In 1915, his family moved to Königsberg, in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), the home of his mother's family; Warschawski studied at the University of Königsberg until 1926 and then moved to the University of Göttingen for his doctoral studies under the supervision of Alexander Ostrowski. Ostrowski soon moved to the University of Basel and Warschawski followed him there to complete his studies. After receiving his Ph.D., Warschawski took a position at Göttingen in 1930 but, due to the rise of Hitler and his own Jewish ancestry, he soon moved to Utrecht University in Utrecht, Netherlands and then Columbia University in New York City. After a sequence of temporary positions, he found a permanent faculty position at Washington University in St. Louis in 1939. During World War II he moved to Brown University and then the University of Minnesota, where he remained until his 1963 move to San Diego, where he was the founding chair of the mathematics department. Warschawski stepped down as chair in 1967, and retired in 1971, but remained active in research: approximately one third of his research publications were written after his retirement. Over the course of his career, he advised 19 Ph.D. students, all but one at either Minnesota or San Diego. Vernor Vinge is among Warschawski's doctoral students.He was known for his research on complex analysis and in particular on conformal maps. He also made contributions to the theory of minimal surfaces and harmonic functions. The Noshiro–Warschawski theorem is named after Warschawski and Noshiro, who discovered it independently; it states that, if ƒ is an analytic function on the open unit disk such that the real part of its first derivative is positive, then ƒ is one-to-one. In 1980 he solved the Visser–Ostrowski problem for derivatives of conformal mappings at the boundary.Warschawski was honored in 1978 by the creation of the Stefan E. Warschawski Assistant Professorship at San Diego. The Stephen E. Warschawski Memorial Scholarship was also given in his name in 1999–2000 to four UCSD undergraduates as a one-time award.

He was the co-founder of the Courant Institute at New York University, and a recipient of the National Medal of Science.Friedrichs was born in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein on September 28, 1901. His family soon moved to Düsseldorf, where he grew up. He attended several different universities in Germany studying the philosophical works of Heidegger and Husserl, but finally decided that mathematics was his real calling. During the 1920s, Friedrichs pursued this field in Göttingen, which had a renowned Mathematical Institute under the direction of Richard Courant. Courant became a close colleague and lifelong friend of Friedrichs.In 1931, Friedrichs became a full professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule in Braunschweig. In early February 1933, a few days after Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany, Friedrichs met and immediately fell in love with a young Jewish student, Nellie Bruell. Their relationship became increasingly challenging and difficult because of the anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws of Hitler's government. In 1937, both Friedrichs and Nellie Bruell managed to emigrate separately to New York City where they finally married. Their long and very happy marriage produced five children.Courant had left Germany in 1933 and had founded an institute for graduate studies in mathematics at New York University. Friedrichs joined him when he arrived in 1937 and remained there for forty years. He was instrumental in the development of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, which eventually became one of the most distinguished research institutes for applied mathematics in the world. Friedrichs died in New Rochelle, New York on December 31, 1982.Friedrichs's greatest contribution to applied mathematics was his work on partial differential equations. He also did major research and wrote many books and papers on existence theory, numerical methods, differential operators in Hilbert space, non-linear buckling of plates, flows past wings, solitary waves, shock waves, combustion, magneto-fluid dynamical shock waves, relativistic flows, quantum field theory, perturbation of the continuous spectrum, scattering theory, and symmetric hyperbolic equations. With Cartan, Friedrichs gave a \"geometrized\" formulation of Newtonian gravitation theory—also knownas “Newton–Cartan theory”— and later developed by Dautcourt, Dixon, Dombrowski and Horneffer, Ehlers, Havas, Künzle, Lottermoser, Trautman, and others.A member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1959, Friedrichs received many honorary degrees and awards for his work. There is a student prize named after Friedrichs at NYU. The American Mathematical Society selected him as the Josiah Willards Gibbs lecturer for 1954. In November 1977, Friedrichs received the National Medal of Science from President Jimmy Carter \"for bringing the powers of modern mathematics to bear on problems in physics, fluid dynamics, and elasticity.\"", "fact_context": "Kurt O.

He was the first mayor of Rochdale on the town's incorporation as a municipal borough. He stood for election in 1865 in Manchester. Although unsuccessful on his first attempt, he won a by-election in 1867. The election was notable because Lilly Maxwell voted for Bright. This vote by a woman was later overturned.Bright held his seat at the general election in 1868. He lost his seat at the 1874 general election, but was returned to parliament at the by-election in 1876. When the three-seat Parliamentary Borough of Manchester was divided into eight single-seat constituencies in 1885, Bright was selected as the Liberal candidate for the new Manchester South West constituency. He was defeated in 1885, but successful in the general election in 1886. As a Member of Parliament, Bright was considered an \"advanced radical\".

He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform. Kennedy retired from office in 1854, but continued to take keen interest in political affairs and up to his death in 1879 took a great part in both county and parish business.

He has been a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly since 2004, representing three successive seats: Charters Towers (2004–2009), Dalrymple (2009–2017) and Hill (2017–present). He has variously represented the National Party (2004–08), the Liberal National Party (2008–11) and Katter's Australian Party (2011–present).Knuth was born in the Queensland town of Tully. His brother Jeff Knuth is a former One Nation parliamentarian.Shane Knuth entered the state parliament as the member for Charters Towers at the 2004 state election by defeating incumbent MP Christine Scott of the Labor Party on One Nation preferences. At the 2006 state election, Knuth was re-elected with a large swing.Charters Towers was abolished in a redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election, and Knuth opted to contest the new seat of Dalrymple. The new seat merged most of his former territory, including the city of Charters Towers, with part of the former seat of Tablelands, represented by One Nation MP Rosa Lee Long. The new seat had a notional LNP majority of 57 percent, and Knuth won with only a small swing against him.On 30 October 2011, Knuth resigned from the Liberal National Party to join Katter's Australian Party. Though most LNP MPs at the time were former Nationals like Knuth, Knuth contended the merger had been a Liberal takeover that had been \"disastrous\" for regional representation, and left rural MPs shut out of decision-making. Knuth also cited reports that the LNP's organisational wing grilled candidates, and had paid a former Labor official for compromising information on Labor MPs, including their sexual behaviour, as having influenced his decision.At the 2012 state election, despite a massive swing to the LNP statewide, Knuth easily retained his seat, defeating his replacement as LNP candidate by a nearly 2-to-1 two-party margin, winning enough primary votes to retain the seat outright. He was re-elected almost as easily in 2015.Dalrymple was abolished in a redistribution ahead of the 2017 election, and Knuth transferred to Hill, essentially the northern portion of his old seat.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4–5 loss).The team’s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968–69. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013–14, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Carlos Alós Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n André Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018. \n Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017. \n Čedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021.", "keyword": ["Aug, 2016", "Currently", "the first division", "April 1944", "following the merger", "1936", "1936", "whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations", "newly born", "the first football match", "the first half of the year 1945", "some weeks before the end of World War II", "the first recorded encounter", "16 September 1945", "1971", "2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division", "Until the early 1960s", "since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions", "1965", "From the very beginning", "after four attempts", "1968–69", "Since then", "until 2013–14", "for the first time", "after finishing 13th in the league"]}

He has been a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly since 2004, representing three successive seats: Charters Towers (2004–2009), Dalrymple (2009–2017) and Hill (2017–present). He has variously represented the National Party (2004–08), the Liberal National Party (2008–11) and Katter's Australian Party (2011–present).Knuth was born in the Queensland town of Tully. His brother Jeff Knuth is a former One Nation parliamentarian.Shane Knuth entered the state parliament as the member for Charters Towers at the 2004 state election by defeating incumbent MP Christine Scott of the Labor Party on One Nation preferences. At the 2006 state election, Knuth was re-elected with a large swing.Charters Towers was abolished in a redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election, and Knuth opted to contest the new seat of Dalrymple. The new seat merged most of his former territory, including the city of Charters Towers, with part of the former seat of Tablelands, represented by One Nation MP Rosa Lee Long. The new seat had a notional LNP majority of 57 percent, and Knuth won with only a small swing against him.On 30 October 2011, Knuth resigned from the Liberal National Party to join Katter's Australian Party. Though most LNP MPs at the time were former Nationals like Knuth, Knuth contended the merger had been a Liberal takeover that had been \"disastrous\" for regional representation, and left rural MPs shut out of decision-making. Knuth also cited reports that the LNP's organisational wing grilled candidates, and had paid a former Labor official for compromising information on Labor MPs, including their sexual behaviour, as having influenced his decision.At the 2012 state election, despite a massive swing to the LNP statewide, Knuth easily retained his seat, defeating his replacement as LNP candidate by a nearly 2-to-1 two-party margin, winning enough primary votes to retain the seat outright. He was re-elected almost as easily in 2015.Dalrymple was abolished in a redistribution ahead of the 2017 election, and Knuth transferred to Hill, essentially the northern portion of his old seat.

It became the CSN only in 1960 when it became secular. The CSN developed a close relationship with the Quebec Liberal Party and worked together to reform Québec's labor law in 1965 to extend collective bargaining to government employees. However, by the late 1960s the CSN had fallen out of favor with the provincial government as it became radicalized and threw its support behind social movements.In 1971, the three leading Quebec unions, the CSN, the CEQ teacher's union, and the Québec Federation of Labour (FTQ) voted to form the Common Front, a syndicalist organization demanding a unified minimum wage for their 250,000 members. When negotiations failed between the Common Front and the Liberal government, the unions launched the largest general strike in Canadian history. When the strike's leaders were jailed for defying orders to return to work, the strike lost momentum and the Common Front broke apart.The CSN first formally supported Quebec sovereignty in May 1990. It had, however, been associated with the sovereignty movement long before. In both the 1973 and 1976 provincial elections, the CSN, without formally endorsing the Parti québécois, let it be known that it considered the PQ to be most closely aligned with workers' interests. During the 1980 Quebec referendum, the CSN supported a yes vote on \"sovereignty-association\".The CSN is characterized by decentralized administration: local unions are organized into federations by sector of activity and regional councils, and are very independent from the central organization. It is also the most politically active trade union in Quebec.The Confederation currently has about 300,000 members, distributed evenly between men and women, and between the private and public sectors.

Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors.His most noted work was the 1954 book \"The Foundations of Statistics\", in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory.During World War II, Savage served as chief \"statistical\" assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \"random walk\" (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.In 1951 he introduced the minimax regret criterion used in decision theory.The Hewitt–Savage zero–one law is (in part) named after him, as is the Friedman–Savage utility function.", "fact_context": "Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences from Jan, 1945 to Jan, 1946. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Chicago from Jan, 1946 to Jan, 1960. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Brown University from Jan, 1943 to Jan, 1944. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Institute for Advanced Study from Jan, 1941 to Jan, 1942. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Columbia University from Jan, 1944 to Jan, 1945. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Yale University from Jan, 1964 to Jan, 1971. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Cornell University from Jan, 1942 to Jan, 1943. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Michigan from Jan, 1960 to Jan, 1964.", "keyword": ["in Jul, 1946", "20 November 1917", "1 November 1971", "later", "1954", "During World War II", "Later", "subsequent", "subsequently", "1951"]}

Andræ was by royal appointment a member of the 1848 Danish Constituent Assembly. In 1854, he became Finance Minister in the Cabinet of Bang before also becoming Council President of Denmark 1856-1857 as leader of the Cabinet of Andræ. After being replaced as Council President by Carl Christian Hall in 1857 Andræ continued as Finance Minister in the Cabinet of Hall I until 1858.

If until that year the Council was elected under a pure proportional system and the President of Lombardy was chosen and dismissed by the Council, since 1995 the President and the Council are jointly elected by the people.The Regional Council of Lombardy is composed of 80 members. From 1995 to 2012, 64 councillors were elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 16 councillors (elected in bloc) came from a \"regional list\", including the President-elect. One seat was reserved for the candidate who came second. If a coalition won more than 40 seats with PR, as happened during the 2000 election, only 8 candidates from the regional list would be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 72. If the winning coalition received less than 50% of votes, as happened during the 1995 election, special seats were added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.A new Lombard electoral law was adopted on 26 October 2012. While the President of Lombardy and the leader of the opposition are still elected at-large, 78 councillors, instead of 64 as it was before, are elected by party lists under a form of semi-proportional representation. The winning coalition receives a jackpot of at least 45 seats, which are divided between all majority parties using the D'Hondt method, as it happens between the losing lists. Each party then distributes its seats to its provincial lists, where candidates are openly selected.The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the \"simul stabunt, simul cadent\" clause introduced in 1999 (literally \"they will stand together or they will fall together\"), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.The Council chooses its speaker, called President of the Council (\"Presidente del Consiglio\").The Council is composed of the following political groups:By coalition:This is a list of the Presidents of the Regional Council (Italian: \"Presidenti del Consiglio regionale\"):", "fact_context": "Davide Boni is the chair of Regional Council of Lombardy from May, 2010 to May, 2012. \n Giulio Achille De Capitani is the chair of Regional Council of Lombardy from Jul, 2008 to May, 2010. \n Ettore Adalberto Albertoni is the chair of Regional Council of Lombardy from Jul, 2006 to Jul, 2008. \n Attilio Fontana is the chair of Regional Council of Lombardy from Jun, 2000 to Jul, 2006.", "keyword": ["Aug, 2011", "first", "1970", "1948", "1995", "until that year", "since 1995", "From 1995 to 2012", "while", "second", "during the 2000 election", "during the 1995 election", "26 October 2012", "While", "before", "then", "for a five-year term", "1999"]}

His research focuses on the mechanisms of innate immunity and endosymbiosis in Drosophila. Lemaitre has also authored several books on the topic of narcissism in science.Lemaitre obtained a PhD in genetics from the Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie in 1992, defending a thesis on the regulation of P element transposition in Drosophila. He then pursued work as research associate in the laboratory of Jules Hoffmann, where he identified Toll-like receptors as essential mediators of innate immunity in Drosophila. This work was considered as a landmark paper by the Nobel prize committee and was featured in the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Hoffmann. In 1998, he was appointed group leader at the Molecular Genetics Center of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-Yvette. He moved to EPFL in 2007 as a full professor within the Global Health Institute.Lemaitre has since 2016 published several books and essays related to the topic of narcissism in science and society. He is co-author of various MOOCs and an exercise book in French on the topic of immunology.The Lemaitre laboratory studies various aspects of innate immunity using Drosophila as a genetic model. The laboratory uses genetic screens as tools to identify novel factors involved in the immune response following microbial infection. His team has contributed to the better understanding the role of the Toll and NF-κB pathways in the activation of bacterial defense, as well as how the host's immune system discriminates between different bacterial pathogens. Lemaitre also studies host-microbiota interactions, and more specifically how the microbiota influences gut homeostasis and morphology.Another aspect of interest to Lemaitre is to decipher the roles and mechanisms of the interactions occurring between Drosophila and its endosymbionts of the spiroplasma genus.Lemaitre received two \"Advanced Grants\" from the European Research Council for projects on gut immunity and homeostasis (2008) and Drosophila-Spiroplasma interactions (2013).Lemaitre was elected as an EMBO member in 2007.He received several research prizes, such as the Noury, Thorlet, Lazare Prize from the French Academy of Sciences (2001), the First Prize of the Schlumberger Foundation (2002), the William B.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4–5 loss).The team’s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968–69. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013–14, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "Carlos Alós Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017. \n André Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021. \n Čedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020.", "keyword": ["in Apr, 2020", "Currently", "April 1944", "following", "1936", "first football match", "first half of the year 1945", "some weeks before the end of World War II", "first recorded encounter", "16 September 1945", "1971", "2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division", "Until the early 1960s", "1965", "From the very beginning", "after four attempts", "finish first", "1968–69", "Since then", "until 2013–14", "for the first time", "after finishing 13th in the league"]}

On 8 May 2007, he was elected as one of the three Deputy Speakers of the Assembly.McClarty served on the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee and the Environment Committee in the Assembly from 1998 to 2002.He was one of a number of high-profile Ulster Unionist moderates who left the party along with Harry Hamilton and Paula Bradshaw, both of whom joined the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, and Trevor Ringland, who joined the NI Conservatives.McClarty appeared to dismiss speculation about switching to the Alliance by saying, \"It has been suggested that, with my moderate views, I should go Alliance like Harry Hamilton in Upper Bann.

There are many Slutsky analogs in producer theory.He is less well known by Western economists than some of his contemporaries, due to his own changing intellectual interests as well as external factors forced upon him after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. His seminal paper in Economics, and some argue his last paper in Economics rather than probability theory, was published in 1915 (\"Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore\"). Paul Samuelson noted that until 1936, he had been entirely unaware of Slutsky's 1915 \"masterpiece\" due to World War I and the paper's Italian language publication. R. G. D. Allen did the most to propagate Slutsky's work on consumer theory in published papers in 1936 and 1950.Vincent Barnett argues:In the 1920s Slutsky turned to working on probability theory and stochastic processes, but in 1927 he published his second famous article on economic theory, 'The Summation of Random Causes as a Source of Cyclical Processes'. This showed that it was possible for apparently cyclic behaviour to emerge as the result of random shocks to the economy if the latter were modelled using a stable stochastic difference equation with certain technical properties. This opened up a new approach to business cycle theory by hypothesising that the interaction of chance events could generate periodicity when none existed initially.Slutsky's later work was principally in probability theory and the theory of stochastic processes.

The building is three stories high and based on an Elizabethan-style \"E\"-shaped plan. The design is similar to that of the station but more subdued; the building was extended in 1878. The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls—a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success. When the NSR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, the LMS took over the hotel and found the business in poor condition. When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space. Not all the extensions were conducted sympathetically to the original architectural style, resulting in a variety of architectural styles to the rear of the building.The hotel became a listed building in 1972 and is listed in grade II*.

Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics Emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis. His research includes the study of intellectual property and endogenous growth in dynamic general equilibrium models, the endogenous formation of preferences, social norms and institutions, learning in games, and game theory applications to experimental economics.At UCLA, Levine obtained a B.A. in mathematics in 1977, and an M.A. in economics in the same year. He was awarded a Ph.D. in economics at MIT in June 1981. He became an assistant professor of economics at UCLA in July 1981, an associate professor of economics at the University of Minnesota in 1987, and a professor of economics at UCLA in the same year. In 1997 he became the Armen Alchian Professor of Economics at UCLA. In 2006 he moved to Washington University in St. Louis, where he became the John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics.Levine was the coeditor of the \"Review of Economic Dynamics\" from November 1996 to June 2001, and of \"Econometrica\" from July 2003 to June 2008. He presided the Society for Economic Dynamics from July 2006 to June 2009.Levine is a Fellow of the Econometric Society since 1989 and a research associate at NBER since 2006.David K. Levine conducts ongoing research in general equilibrium theory, focusing specifically on growth theory, innovation, and intellectual property. Collaborating with Michele Boldrin, Levine examines the role of increasing returns in growth and innovation. They posit that little evidence exists for increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in growth. This theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.Levine also conducts research in the field of dynamic games. He established with Drew Fudenberg that a long-lived player playing in opposition to short-lived players can substitute reputation for commitment. He developed with Eric Maskin the first \"folk theorem\" for games in which players do not directly observe each other's decisions, with applications for learning in games. They argued that while learning theories cannot provide detailed descriptions of non-equilibrium behavior, they act as a useful tool in understanding which equilibria are likely to emerge. One example of this, they put forward, explains how superstitions survive in the face of rational learning.Levine currently studies the endogenous formation of preferences and social norms. His analysis of experimental anomalies explores some of the limitations of the standard economic model of self-interested individuals.", "fact_context": "David K.

He then pursued work as research associate in the laboratory of Jules Hoffmann, where he identified Toll-like receptors as essential mediators of innate immunity in Drosophila. This work was considered as a landmark paper by the Nobel prize committee and was featured in the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Hoffmann. In 1998, he was appointed group leader at the Molecular Genetics Center of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-Yvette. He moved to EPFL in 2007 as a full professor within the Global Health Institute.Lemaitre has since 2016 published several books and essays related to the topic of narcissism in science and society. He is co-author of various MOOCs and an exercise book in French on the topic of immunology.The Lemaitre laboratory studies various aspects of innate immunity using Drosophila as a genetic model. The laboratory uses genetic screens as tools to identify novel factors involved in the immune response following microbial infection. His team has contributed to the better understanding the role of the Toll and NF-κB pathways in the activation of bacterial defense, as well as how the host's immune system discriminates between different bacterial pathogens.

The last years of the reign of Isabella II were times of growing discontent with her government and with the monarchy. Salmerón joined a small party who advocated for the establishment of a republic. He was director of the opposition paper \"La Discusión\", and co-operated with Emilio Castelar on \"La Democracia\". In 1865 he was named one of the members of the directing committee of the Republican Party. In 1867 he was imprisoned with other suspects.When the revolution of September 1868 broke out, he was at Almería recovering from a serious illness. Salmerón was elected to the \"Cortes\" in 1871, and though he did not belong to the Socialist Party, defended its right to toleration. When Amadeo of Savoy resigned the Spanish crown on 11 February 1873 Salmerón was naturally marked out to be a leader of the party which endeavoured to establish a republic in Spain. After serving as minister of justice in the Figueras cabinet, he was chosen president of the \"Cortes\", and then, on 18 July 1873, president of the Executive Power of the Republic, in succession to Francisco Pi y Margall. He became president at a time when the Federalist Party had thrown all the south of Spain into anarchy.Salmerón was compelled to use the troops to restore order. When, however, he found that the generals insisted on executing rebels taken in arms, he resigned (September 6) on the ground that he was opposed to capital punishment. He was again elected president of the Cortes on September 9. His successor, Castelar, was compelled to restore order by drastic means. Salmerón took part in the attack made on him in the \"Cortes\" on 3 January 1874, which provoked the generals into closing the chamber and establishing a provisional military government. Salmerón went into exile and remained abroad till 1881, when he was recalled by Sagasta.In 1886, he was elected to the \"Cortes\" as Progressive deputy for Madrid, and unsuccessfully endeavoured to combine the jarring republican factions into a party of practical moderate views. On 18 April 1907 he was shot at, but not wounded, in the streets of Barcelona by a member of the more extreme Republican Party.

Flagg, of Grand Manan, New Brunswick.Gould left school at the age of 14 and started work for 4 shillings a week.In 1901 he obtained a position as an ordinary sailor on the ship \"Clan Graham\", and sailed for South Africa where he worked as a piecemeal laborer. He later moved from South Africa to New York where he worked for an insurance company.In 1912 he opened his own insurance company in London with offices in Belgium and Germany. The business closed within a year and Gould won a £20,000 award against a partner in New York for misrepresentation.In 1915, with a capital of £200, Gould committed to buy the SS \"Dartsmouth\" for £36,000. Due to the need for ships during the First World War to carry troops and goods, the venture was extremely successful, bringing capital to Gould and his company, Goulds Steamships & Industrials Ltd of £60,000 within 6 months. The profits were re-invested with the purchase of a £1,000,000 navy and shipbuilding business. By the end of the War it was estimated that Gould's personal fortune was around £2 million.

WarschawskiStefan Emanuel \"Steve\" Warschawski (April 18, 1904 – May 5, 1989) was a mathematician, a professor and department chair at the University of Minnesota and the founder of the mathematics department at the University of California, San Diego.Warschawski was born in Lida, now in Belarus; at the time of his birth Lida was part of the Russian Empire. His father was a Russian medical doctor, and his mother was ethnically German; the family spoke German at home. In 1915, his family moved to Königsberg, in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), the home of his mother's family; Warschawski studied at the University of Königsberg until 1926 and then moved to the University of Göttingen for his doctoral studies under the supervision of Alexander Ostrowski. Ostrowski soon moved to the University of Basel and Warschawski followed him there to complete his studies. After receiving his Ph.D., Warschawski took a position at Göttingen in 1930 but, due to the rise of Hitler and his own Jewish ancestry, he soon moved to Utrecht University in Utrecht, Netherlands and then Columbia University in New York City. After a sequence of temporary positions, he found a permanent faculty position at Washington University in St. Louis in 1939. During World War II he moved to Brown University and then the University of Minnesota, where he remained until his 1963 move to San Diego, where he was the founding chair of the mathematics department. Warschawski stepped down as chair in 1967, and retired in 1971, but remained active in research: approximately one third of his research publications were written after his retirement. Over the course of his career, he advised 19 Ph.D. students, all but one at either Minnesota or San Diego. Vernor Vinge is among Warschawski's doctoral students.He was known for his research on complex analysis and in particular on conformal maps. He also made contributions to the theory of minimal surfaces and harmonic functions. The Noshiro–Warschawski theorem is named after Warschawski and Noshiro, who discovered it independently; it states that, if ƒ is an analytic function on the open unit disk such that the real part of its first derivative is positive, then ƒ is one-to-one. In 1980 he solved the Visser–Ostrowski problem for derivatives of conformal mappings at the boundary.Warschawski was honored in 1978 by the creation of the Stefan E. Warschawski Assistant Professorship at San Diego. The Stephen E. Warschawski Memorial Scholarship was also given in his name in 1999–2000 to four UCSD undergraduates as a one-time award.

The building is three stories high and based on an Elizabethan-style \"E\"-shaped plan. The design is similar to that of the station but more subdued; the building was extended in 1878. The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls—a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success. When the NSR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, the LMS took over the hotel and found the business in poor condition. When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space. Not all the extensions were conducted sympathetically to the original architectural style, resulting in a variety of architectural styles to the rear of the building.The hotel became a listed building in 1972 and is listed in grade II*.

His research includes the study of intellectual property and endogenous growth in dynamic general equilibrium models, the endogenous formation of preferences, social norms and institutions, learning in games, and game theory applications to experimental economics.At UCLA, Levine obtained a B.A. in mathematics in 1977, and an M.A. in economics in the same year. He was awarded a Ph.D. in economics at MIT in June 1981. He became an assistant professor of economics at UCLA in July 1981, an associate professor of economics at the University of Minnesota in 1987, and a professor of economics at UCLA in the same year. In 1997 he became the Armen Alchian Professor of Economics at UCLA. In 2006 he moved to Washington University in St. Louis, where he became the John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics.Levine was the coeditor of the \"Review of Economic Dynamics\" from November 1996 to June 2001, and of \"Econometrica\" from July 2003 to June 2008. He presided the Society for Economic Dynamics from July 2006 to June 2009.Levine is a Fellow of the Econometric Society since 1989 and a research associate at NBER since 2006.David K. Levine conducts ongoing research in general equilibrium theory, focusing specifically on growth theory, innovation, and intellectual property. Collaborating with Michele Boldrin, Levine examines the role of increasing returns in growth and innovation. They posit that little evidence exists for increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in growth. This theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.Levine also conducts research in the field of dynamic games. He established with Drew Fudenberg that a long-lived player playing in opposition to short-lived players can substitute reputation for commitment. He developed with Eric Maskin the first \"folk theorem\" for games in which players do not directly observe each other's decisions, with applications for learning in games. They argued that while learning theories cannot provide detailed descriptions of non-equilibrium behavior, they act as a useful tool in understanding which equilibria are likely to emerge. One example of this, they put forward, explains how superstitions survive in the face of rational learning.Levine currently studies the endogenous formation of preferences and social norms. His analysis of experimental anomalies explores some of the limitations of the standard economic model of self-interested individuals.", "fact_context": "David K.

It is exhibited at the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam, and signed, below the window in the lower left-hand corner, \"I V MEER\".The painting is made in oil on canvas, and it is a relatively small painting, being high by wide.The painting, showing a quiet street, depicts a typical aspect of the life in a Dutch Golden Age town. It is one of only three Vermeer paintings of views of Delft, the others being \"View of Delft\" and the now lost \"House Standing in Delft\". This painting is considered to be an important work of the Dutch master.Straight angles alternate with the triangle of the house and of the sky giving the composition a certain vitality. The walls, stones and brickwork are painted in a thicker paint layer, such that it makes them almost palpable.Vermeer achieved the realistic depiction of the surfaces with the masterful application of a relatively limited number of pigments. He employed red ochre and madder lake for the reddish-brown brick wall, the blue in the sky contains lead white and natural ultramarine. The green shutters and foliage are painted with azurite mixed with lead-tin-yellow.While generally agreed to depict a contemporary street scene in 17th-century Delft, where Vermeer lived and worked, the exact location of the scene Vermeer painted has long been a topic of research and discussion, with studies arguing for the Voldersgracht, where the Vermeer Centre is located, or the Nieuwe Langendijk at the present-day numbers 22 to 26.In 2015, archival research based on the city's quay dues register, which gives detailed measurements of all houses and passageways along the canals of Delft at the time, has resulted in the conclusion that the site is the Vlamingstraat, a street with a narrow canal, at the present-day numbers 40 and 42.The research also found that the property on the right in the painting belonged to Vermeer’s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne. She had a business selling tripe, and the passageway beside the house was known as the \"Penspoort\", or Tripe Gate. Vermeer’s mother and sister also lived on the same canal, diagonally opposite.In 2017, this apparently sound conclusion was disputed by art historians Gert Eijkelboom and Gerrit Vermeer in the Dutch \"Journal of Historical Geography\" (\"Tijdschrift voor historische geografie\"). Their argumentation is essentially founded in the assertion that the painting does not depict an actual place, and thus cannot be accurately located.

Clara was nine years older than Woldemar. Throughout their lives, they enjoyed a warm relationship. The initial opportunities which led to the success and recognition he enjoyed were due to Clara, who introduced him to both Robert Schumann and Felix Mendelssohn.

After leaving Leipzig in 1850, he returned to Berlin where he tried to make ends meet by giving private lessons. Eventually, Clara and Robert were able to arrange for the publication of some of his early works, including his First Piano Trio.Subsequently, Bargiel held positions at the conservatories in Cologne and Rotterdam (where he met Hermine Tours, his future wife, sister of the composer Berthold Tours) before accepting a position at the prestigious Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin where he taught for the rest of his life.

His father was a Russian medical doctor, and his mother was ethnically German; the family spoke German at home. In 1915, his family moved to Königsberg, in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), the home of his mother's family; Warschawski studied at the University of Königsberg until 1926 and then moved to the University of Göttingen for his doctoral studies under the supervision of Alexander Ostrowski. Ostrowski soon moved to the University of Basel and Warschawski followed him there to complete his studies. After receiving his Ph.D., Warschawski took a position at Göttingen in 1930 but, due to the rise of Hitler and his own Jewish ancestry, he soon moved to Utrecht University in Utrecht, Netherlands and then Columbia University in New York City. After a sequence of temporary positions, he found a permanent faculty position at Washington University in St. Louis in 1939. During World War II he moved to Brown University and then the University of Minnesota, where he remained until his 1963 move to San Diego, where he was the founding chair of the mathematics department. Warschawski stepped down as chair in 1967, and retired in 1971, but remained active in research: approximately one third of his research publications were written after his retirement. Over the course of his career, he advised 19 Ph.D. students, all but one at either Minnesota or San Diego.

The last years of the reign of Isabella II were times of growing discontent with her government and with the monarchy. Salmerón joined a small party who advocated for the establishment of a republic. He was director of the opposition paper \"La Discusión\", and co-operated with Emilio Castelar on \"La Democracia\". In 1865 he was named one of the members of the directing committee of the Republican Party. In 1867 he was imprisoned with other suspects.When the revolution of September 1868 broke out, he was at Almería recovering from a serious illness. Salmerón was elected to the \"Cortes\" in 1871, and though he did not belong to the Socialist Party, defended its right to toleration. When Amadeo of Savoy resigned the Spanish crown on 11 February 1873 Salmerón was naturally marked out to be a leader of the party which endeavoured to establish a republic in Spain. After serving as minister of justice in the Figueras cabinet, he was chosen president of the \"Cortes\", and then, on 18 July 1873, president of the Executive Power of the Republic, in succession to Francisco Pi y Margall. He became president at a time when the Federalist Party had thrown all the south of Spain into anarchy.Salmerón was compelled to use the troops to restore order. When, however, he found that the generals insisted on executing rebels taken in arms, he resigned (September 6) on the ground that he was opposed to capital punishment. He was again elected president of the Cortes on September 9. His successor, Castelar, was compelled to restore order by drastic means. Salmerón took part in the attack made on him in the \"Cortes\" on 3 January 1874, which provoked the generals into closing the chamber and establishing a provisional military government. Salmerón went into exile and remained abroad till 1881, when he was recalled by Sagasta.In 1886, he was elected to the \"Cortes\" as Progressive deputy for Madrid, and unsuccessfully endeavoured to combine the jarring republican factions into a party of practical moderate views. On 18 April 1907 he was shot at, but not wounded, in the streets of Barcelona by a member of the more extreme Republican Party.

There are many Slutsky analogs in producer theory.He is less well known by Western economists than some of his contemporaries, due to his own changing intellectual interests as well as external factors forced upon him after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. His seminal paper in Economics, and some argue his last paper in Economics rather than probability theory, was published in 1915 (\"Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore\"). Paul Samuelson noted that until 1936, he had been entirely unaware of Slutsky's 1915 \"masterpiece\" due to World War I and the paper's Italian language publication. R. G. D. Allen did the most to propagate Slutsky's work on consumer theory in published papers in 1936 and 1950.Vincent Barnett argues:In the 1920s Slutsky turned to working on probability theory and stochastic processes, but in 1927 he published his second famous article on economic theory, 'The Summation of Random Causes as a Source of Cyclical Processes'. This showed that it was possible for apparently cyclic behaviour to emerge as the result of random shocks to the economy if the latter were modelled using a stable stochastic difference equation with certain technical properties. This opened up a new approach to business cycle theory by hypothesising that the interaction of chance events could generate periodicity when none existed initially.Slutsky's later work was principally in probability theory and the theory of stochastic processes.

A Fulbright Fellowship in 1949 supported him at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, where he hiked the Peloponnesos with his new wife and gained an intimate knowledge of inscriptions. After a brief stint at the University of Minnesota, he accepted a Ford Fellowship at the Institute for Social Anthropology at Oxford University. On his return to the United States, be began his long association with the University of Pennsylvania (1954–76).Though a spirit of perfectionism inhibited his production of an overarching book, in some sixty articles he explored the setting of Greek religion in its specific locality and time, thus focusing on unravelling the details of cult and ritual sacrifice; he did a great deal of work on epigraphy and its relations with literature and history, and he explored Greek sites, especially at the partly drowned port city of Halieis (Porto Cheli), which he began excavating in 1962, and in the Argolid, where he galvanized a broad ecological study, 1979–83, that was the first examination of the paleoecology of ancient Greece, resulting in the publication of M.

His father was doctor and his mother a homemaker. He read philosophy at the University of Canterbury (formerly Canterbury University College) and was awarded his MA there in 1953. He then went to the University of Oxford where he was a member of Magdalen College, Oxford. He obtained his BPhil in 1955.Bennett's first academic post was as a Junior Lecturer at the University of Auckland, New Zealand (then Auckland University College) (1952).

His lectures were refined and published in his 1995 book \"The Act Itself\". In this work he argues that letting someone die is as immoral as killing someone. This also applies to other harms that one commits or fails to prevent. This view has been widely discussed for example by Judith Jarvis ThomsonIn 1992, he was the John Locke Lecturer at the University of Oxford giving lectures on 'Judging Behaviour: Analysis in Moral Theory'. In 1985, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The British Academy extended him the same honour in 1991. In the same year he was awarded a LittD from the University of Cambridge.Bennett has written extensively on philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, events, conditionals, and consequentialist ethics. He is particularly renowned for his interpretations of major early modern philosophers and he has written five books in this area.

He was the first mayor of Rochdale on the town's incorporation as a municipal borough. He stood for election in 1865 in Manchester.

There are many Slutsky analogs in producer theory.He is less well known by Western economists than some of his contemporaries, due to his own changing intellectual interests as well as external factors forced upon him after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. His seminal paper in Economics, and some argue his last paper in Economics rather than probability theory, was published in 1915 (\"Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore\"). Paul Samuelson noted that until 1936, he had been entirely unaware of Slutsky's 1915 \"masterpiece\" due to World War I and the paper's Italian language publication. R. G. D. Allen did the most to propagate Slutsky's work on consumer theory in published papers in 1936 and 1950.Vincent Barnett argues:In the 1920s Slutsky turned to working on probability theory and stochastic processes, but in 1927 he published his second famous article on economic theory, 'The Summation of Random Causes as a Source of Cyclical Processes'. This showed that it was possible for apparently cyclic behaviour to emerge as the result of random shocks to the economy if the latter were modelled using a stable stochastic difference equation with certain technical properties. This opened up a new approach to business cycle theory by hypothesising that the interaction of chance events could generate periodicity when none existed initially.Slutsky's later work was principally in probability theory and the theory of stochastic processes. He is generally credited for the result known as Slutsky's theorem.

In 2008 he was appointed associate professor, and in 2017 full professor. Before that, he worked at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, and MIT in the United States. He received his PhD from the University of Amsterdam in 1999 with a thesis entitled \"Millisecond phenomena in X-ray binaries\".His research focuses on the accretion of matter onto neutron stars and black holes, which are very compact stellar remnants. He uses X-ray space telescopes such as Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton to observe the X-ray emission from these objects. In particular he studies neutron stars and black holes when they are accreting at very low rates. He also investigates the rate at which neutron stars cool after they have been heated by accretion, in order to learn about their interior composition. Furthermore, Wijnands has been involved in research into quasi-periodic oscillations.In 1998, Wijnands and his PhD advisor Michiel van der Klis discovered coherent millisecond X-ray pulsations in the persistent flux of the X-ray binary SAX J1808.4-3658. This was strong evidence for the model in which radio millisecond pulsars are spun up to periods of a few milliseconds by the accretion of matter from a companion star in an X-ray binary.In 2006 Wijnands received the Bruno Rossi Prize along with Deepto Chakrabarty and Tod Strohmayer \"for their pioneering research which revealed millisecond spin periods and established the powerful diagnostic tool of kilohertz intensity oscillations in accreting neutron star binary systems\".", "fact_context": "Rudy Wijnands works for Massachusetts Institute of Technology from Sep, 1999 to Aug, 2002. \n Rudy Wijnands works for University of Amsterdam from Feb, 1999 to Aug, 1999. \n Rudy Wijnands works for University of St Andrews from Sep, 2002 to Sep, 2003.", "keyword": ["Apr, 1999", "born 1971", "Since 2004", "In 2008", "in 2017", "Before that", "in 1999", "when", "after", "In 1998", "In 2006"]}
